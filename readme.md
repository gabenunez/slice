# Slice O' Pizza üçï

I found it quite sickening that there was no central location on the internet to find the best pizza deal... so I put on my thinking hat and figured out how I could do it.

And BAM! It came it came to me, let's just source all the pizza newsletters in my local area and make it appear all on one screen! This does exactly that :)
